x    Change camera defaut position to be based on player start position
x    optional use of arrow keys instead of wasd

x    backjump glitch (moonjump) - The way I solved this makes the mid-air left/right button presses seem less responsive. 
        It may not be worth keeping this change in, need to play around with it or find another solution
     
WORLD BUILDER
x        choose background color in worldbuilder (implemented on backend already)
x        let builder specify height and width of world (need to be able to reload page grid)
x        let builder choose player starting position
x    show/hide blocks in worldbuilder depending on which layer is selected
x    add tool icons to make them more clear (eraser/grid)
x    resize collectibles to 70x70 max
     add save function to worldbuilder connected c# database
     function to test current world in editor (waiting for database saves to do this - save level to database, then play it in game.html)
        I Attempted to put the main.js file into the worldbuilder to test a level live and it ended up being very laggy
        could have been caused by the huge worldbuilder div still being displayed, need to try this again and hide the worldbuilder div
