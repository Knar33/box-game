IN PROGRESS:
main.js and objects.js
changing how friction works, adding wind-up to changing x direction on friction surface

TODO: 
x    remove collectible objects from gameworld when you collide
x    add UI with objects left to collect
x    in worldbuilder, if selected = 0 dont put 0.png
x    let builder select where alien goes
x    add win condition
x       collect objects (array of objects to collect)
x       return to spaceship after collecting all objects
x   add scrolling, up and sideways
x       fix scrolling!  
x    add big div to worldbuilder so you can scroll up
x    make browser scroll to bottom at load
x    have player go to next level if they win. If player is at last level, show win screen then return to index
x    add death event (warp back to beginning of level)
x    add reverse animations to player
x    add player down animation
     
BUGS AND MECHANICS
x    add more block types
x       fix spaceship collision
x       ice
x       spike (death)
x       water (death)
x       non-square tiles
x       more collectible object types
x       Make default tile no hitbox (after formatting all tiles in collidable tile pool)
x    apply friction at endstep of horizontal movement, not on collision (multiple collisions were bring applied)
     clean up and refactor code
     general animation function to loop through all objects that need to animate (if other blocks need animation in the future)
     select which world to edit from drop-down, or create new
     test current world in editor
x    fix bug with screen being too small and camera default pos
x    screen going over max width
x    when player dies, move camera back to starting position (dynamically define starting position based on player starting position)
x    Fix camera so it pans to player when viewport size changes
x    Change camera defaut position to be based on player start position
x    optional use of arrow keys instead of wasd
~    turn around time on frictioned surfaces (harder to change direction on ice etc)
     
WORLD BUILDER
     add save function to worldbuilder connected to firebase or c#/php api
x        choose background color in worldbuilder (implemented on backend already)
         let builder specify height and width of world (need to be able to reload page grid)
x        let builder choose player starting position
     revamp worldbuilder page to include instructions
x    show/hide blocks in worldbuilder depending on which layer is selected
     add tool icons to make them more clear (eraser/grid)
     
FRONT END VISUALSs
     revamp index page
     revamp win page
     
OPTIONAL FEATURES FOR THE FUTURE

    + and - symbols for x/y starting pos in worldbuilder
    select player skin
    enemies
    items
    add double jump
