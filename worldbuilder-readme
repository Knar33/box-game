1) go to knar33.github.io/box-game/worldbuilder.html

2) use the world editor to build your world. There are 2 background layers that have no collision with the player, one layer where the player is on where he collides with any object in an _interact tab, and a fourth layer which is in front of the player which also has no collision. The only layer that really matters is the player layer: this is where you need to put your blocks that the player will walk on, obstacles, collectible objects, and the spaceship the player uses to exit a level. the other 3 layers are just for decoration. tabs marked _background will never have collision, even if they are put on the player layer. For example, if you place a tree on the player layer, the player will walk right through it.

3)When you are done building your world, you need to save it. There is no save function yet, so you have to manually do it. 

    Press f12 to open the console
    type this into the console, and hit enter: 
        JSON.stringify(grid);
    copy and everything inside the quotes (but don't include the quotes) and past and save it in a text editor. It should all be contained in curly braces {}. This is your level.

4) to test your level, go to knar33.github.io/box-game/game.html
    
    press f12 to open the console
    type this into the console, and hit enter:
        grid = paste your level here
    then type this into the console and hit enter:
        BuildWorld();
    exit the console (hit f12 or press the x)
    
5) test your world, then go back to the worldbuilder and repeat all the steps :D
